#+TITLE: OCaml Project Euler

This is my first adventure into ML languages (besides very minor experiences
with Haskell and Rust, which borrow concepts from ML) and the first time I try
to actually solve problems using a statically typed functional language. It's
kinda neat!

* Running solutions
You can run a particular problem using e.g.
#+begin_src sh
dune exec ./p01.exe
#+end_src
